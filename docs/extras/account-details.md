Hello Bloomers! ðŸ‘‹

This guide will go over how to change your account details in your client area and minecraft panel, allowing you to change your name, email, and payment details.

## Client Area

## DuckPanel

To start, head over to your sidebar and click the My Account tab.

### Discord Linking

Here you can also set up your Discord account.

When your Discord and DuckPanel accounts are linked, our staff will see all the servers you own or have access to when
you open a ticket. Please note that any significant changes to your server will still require opening a billing ticket
as confirmation.

Simply click 'Link Account' which will redirect to Discord's authorization site.

Make sure you are logged in with the correct account and click 'Authorise'.

You will be redirected back to the DuckPanel where it will show your currently linked account.

If you ever need to unlink your account, simply click 'Unlink Account' in the panel, or 'Deauthorise' under 'Authorised
Apps' in your Discord settings.
