## What does the plugin do?â€‹
This plugin allows you to make your own, customized Minecraft commands. This is such a powerful plugin for every type of server. 

## Some of its most used feautures:
- Make new commands!. (Also registered command)
- Run other plugin commands in a new one
- Perform several commands in one command.
- Make Shortcut/alias commands or override other commands.
- Various features for costumize your commands, like placeholders, scripts (if-else) and more.
- And much, much more...!

### Registered commands
One of the main feautures I like the most is the option to register my own made commands. Your command will show up with tab completion. Use the command field `register: true` to do that. 

:::note
A server restart is needed for registered commands to become effective at 100%.
