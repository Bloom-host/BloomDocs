### What does the plugin do?
This plugin allows you to send a message (like the one below) to a channel in your discord through a discord bot, when somebody receives a punishment. (Muted, Warned, Banned, Unbanned, etc)

:::important
You must have Spicord, a Discord account, and a **Compatible** moderation plugin such as [AdvancedBan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/)
:::

### Installation
Once you download Spicord, BanAnnouncer, and the Moderation plugin of your choice, upload them to your servers `plugins` folder, and restart your server. After you have restarted, head over to the Discord [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), make a new application, and give it a name. Next, you'll want to head to the `Bot` tab on the left hand side, and add a bot. Here you can customize your bot, by giving it a name, Changing it's Avatar, and a lot of other cool features. 

### Setting up your bot
After you've created your Discord Bot, you can find your token in the `Bots` Tab. You'll have to click `Reset Token` and enter your 2fa code if you have it enabled, you will then be able to copy the token. 

:::warning
DO NOT SHARE YOUR BOT TOKEN. 
:::

Once you copy your token, scroll down to the bottom of the page, under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, and enable all three settings.

For the sake of this guide, We're going to use the Administrator permission to guarantee it works correctly. Ideally, you would want to set the **proper permissions** for the channel. 


After you enable the options above, You can head over to the `OAuth2` tab, and select `URL Generator`. Under `Scopes` select `bot` and under `Bot Permissions` select `Administrator`. This will generate a URL at the bottom. Use this invite to add your bot, to your guilds.

### Configuration
#### Ban Announcer
Head over to BanAnnouncer's config `/plugins/banannouncer/config.yml`, and paste the Channel ID of the channel you want to use, in `channels-to-announce`. 

:::note
If you don't know how to get the Channel ID, see [This](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID) guide.
:::

#### Spicord
In your Spicord config `/plugins/Spicord/config.toml`, under the `[[bots]]` section, add your token where it says `"YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"`. After you add your token, find the `addons` section, and add `"ban_announcer"` on the next line. **Make sure you put a comma after the last option already there**

As long as you set everything up correctly, your next punishment should show up in discord!
