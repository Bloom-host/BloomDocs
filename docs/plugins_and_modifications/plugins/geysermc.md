### What does the plugin do?

GeyserMC enables clients from Minecraft Bedrock Edition to join your Minecraft Java server.  

## Usage

:::important
GeyserMC requires your server to be on the latest version.
:::

[Download the plugin](https://ci.nukkitx.com/job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bootstrap/spigot/target/Geyser-Spigot.jar) and upload the jar into your `plugins` folder. Restart or turn on the server. If you need help installing plugins, check out [this guide](https://docs.bloom.host/installing-plugins).  

Once you've installed it, create the allocation 19132 under the ports & proxies on the panel.  

After that, just restart the server, and Bedrock players should now be able to connect to your Java server.  
### Note: If you're also using Floodgate, you will have to set auth-type to floodgate in your Geyser config.yml
