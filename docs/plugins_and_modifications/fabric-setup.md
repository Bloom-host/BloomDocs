### What is Fabric?
> "*Fabric is a lightweight, experimental modding toolchain for Minecraft.*"
> 
> Mods can be used to modify, remove or even add new content to Minecraft.


### Installing Fabric
> Go the the Settings tab on the panel and on the right side you will see Change Server Type box. 
> Edit the boxes to the fabric version you would like to use.
>
> ![Bloom.host Fabric](/plugins_and_modifications/fabric_setup/FabricInstaller.png)

> Click Change Server Type, this will download fabric to your server. 

> You are now done, you are running a fabric server!  
> It's a server without mods though, so it's still purely vanilla at this point, keep reading to learn how to install mods.

### Installing Fabric Mods
> 
> Refer to [this](mods-install.md) guide.
