:::note
Remember to write down the recovery code shown while setting up 2FA, without it you'll be unable to restore access to your account if you lose access to your verification device.

Hit **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** to show a QR code that you can scan. 

For this, download an app on your phone that is a 2FA app, such as [Authy](https://authy.com/).

Then, add a new account and scan the QR code. Once it is scanned, type the token that you have on the app into the Authentication Token box.
