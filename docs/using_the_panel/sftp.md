### What is SFTP? 
**S**SH **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol is one of the most popular methods of securely transferring files to remote servers.

:::important
We recommend you zip the files you want to upload to your server, uploading individual files through SFTP can take a long time. Once you have uploaded the .zip file to your server, you can go to the file manager in our Duck Panel, click on the three dots `...` to the right of the .zip and click on `Extract`.  
:::

### More Actions like compress, extract, rename, and others
If you wish to archive, unarchive or mass delete files, please check out or [guide](../using_the_panel/file-manager-controls.md) on file management through the panel.

### Using SFTP

![console](/using_the_panel/sftp/2.png)

There are several so called *SFTP Clients* few of the more popular ones being [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/), [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). 

To find the login details, navigate to the sidebar of the server, then open the 'Settings' section.

Here you will be able to see your server's SFTP host IP address and port as well as your username! Your SFTP password is the same as your game panel password.
 
*If you have WinSCP installed, you can launch straight away by clicking `Launch SFTP`.*

### Using WinSCP (Recommended, available only on Windows)
Firstly, you'll have to download [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to your computer. - This should be simple with their installation wizard.

With our new panel, you can simply head over to the [Duck Panel](https://mc.bloom.host/) and click 'Launch SFTP' under 'Settings' on the left side of the screen. You'll simply need to enter your panel password and you are good to go!

![console](/using_the_panel/sftp/3.png)

WinSCP is very similar to your basic Windows Explorer. However, on the left side of the screen (green area) you can see your local files and on the right side (blue area), you can see the remote server's files.
You can drag, drop, rename and delete files as you wish.

To do this, install the **SFTP** addon for Visual Studio Code for efficient file transfer.  

1. Install the extension on your IDE.  
   ![VSC addon](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/addon.png)
2. Open a folder for your SFTP files (preferably separated to avoid clutter).  
   ![Windows context menu](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/context-menu.png)
3. Open the command palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P by default) and find the 'SFTP: Config' command.  
   ![VSC command palette](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/command-palette.png)
4. Set up your SFTP credentials in the `sftp.json` config. Be sure to set `uploadOnSave` to `true`.  
   ![sftp.json file](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/sftp.json.png)
5. In your settings, enable 'Download When Open In Remote Explorer'.  
   ![Remote explorer setting](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/remote-explorer.png)
6. That’s it. You can now find your files in the sidebar.  
   ![VSC sidebar](/using_the_panel/sftp/vsc/sidebar.png)

**Tip**: When you open a file that exists locally, avoid editing the local copy. If you edit the same file elsewhere (for example in Bloom File Explorer), there is a risk the local copy will overwrite your changes.
