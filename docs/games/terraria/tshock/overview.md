## Usage

:::caution HEADS UP!
If your server is already using the regular Terraria, install, make sure to [create a backup](/using_the_panel/backups.md) before following the
steps below.

If your server is using [TModLoader](/games/terraria/tmodloader/overview.md) with mods that modify the world, it may not
be possible to use TShock with your existing world.
:::

In order to use TShock on your Bloom server, head over to the 'Settings' tab of your server.

Under the 'Change Server Type' section, select the 'Terraria' server category, and the 'TShock' server type.

Then, press the 'Change Server Type' button right below.

Once that's done, please wait a few minutes while the server is installing the latest version of TShock!
You will see the following output in the server console when it's ready:
