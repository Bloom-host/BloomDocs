description: Learn how you can edit the server list entry for your Rust server!
---

In order to customize the server list entry of your Rust server, head over to the 'Startup' tab of your server in the
[DuckPanel](https://mc.bloom.host).

Here you can adjust all related settings, such as the maximum number of players, the server's name, description, website
URL and header image.

:::caution HEADS UP!
Due to in-game limitations, the header image field must contain a direct link to **512x256** or **1024x512** sized PNG or JPEG
image. We would recommend hosting the image on [Imgur](https://imgur.com) and using the direct link.

Here is an example:

Once you are done tweaking the settings, head back to the 'Console' tab of the panel and restart the server to apply the
changes.

Here is how our example looks in-game:
