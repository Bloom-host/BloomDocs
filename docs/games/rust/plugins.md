## Introduction

It's possible to modify certain aspects of your server by utilizing plugins.

In order to modify the game, the server must use [Oxide/uMod](https://umod.org).

---

## Enabling Oxide/uMod

Before installing any plugins, we have to enable Oxide/uMod on the server.

To do this, open your server in the [DuckPanel](https://mc.bloom.host) and navigate to the 'Startup' tab.

Here, ensure the 'Oxidemod' slider is enabled.

## Installing Plugins

First, we should find some plugins to install. Please ensure to only download plugins from trusted sources, such
as [the official plugin list](https://umod.org/plugins?page=1&sort=downloads&sortdir=desc&categories=rust).

In this example, we will install [Welcomer](https://umod.org/plugins/welcomer) by [Dana](https://umod.org/user/Dana).

Once downloaded, head over to the [File Manager](/using_the_panel/file-manager-controls.md) tab and open the `plugins`
directory within the `oxide` one.

If you have not restarted the server after installing Oxide/uMod, feel free to create these folders manually.

Drag & drop the plugin file into the directory.

Lastly, head back to the 'Console' tab and restart the server. It may take a little while for the server to load for the
first time after installing new plugins, but you will see the status show as 'Running' when it's ready.

Lastly, you can verify that the plugin is installed by using the `plugins` command in-game as
an [administrator](./admin.md) or in the console.

## Configuring Plugins

Almost all plugins have configurations to modify certain aspects of their behaviours.

You can find these configs in the `config` directory within the `oxide` one:
![Configs in file manager](/games/rust/plugins/config-list.png)

Every config is different, but they usually use easy to understand formats, such as JSON or YAML.

Make sure to restart the server to apply the changes.
