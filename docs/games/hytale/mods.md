## Overview

Hytale supports modding out of the box. Its modding system is similar to Minecraft’s, so if you’re already familiar with Minecraft modding, getting started with Hytale mods should feel straightforward.

Unlike Minecraft, Hytale mods are fully server-side. Players do not need to install any mods on their client in order to join your server.
Hytale handles mod installation when a client joins automatically.

## How to add mods

1. Download the mods you want from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/search?page=1&pageSize=20&sortBy=relevancy)
2. Go to your Hytale server in the control panel, open the File Manager, then open the mods folder.
3. Drag and drop the mod or plugin jar into the mods folder.
4. Restart your server to apply the changes.

## How to use mods

The best way to learn how to use a mod is to review its mod page. Most mods list their available commands and configuration options there (for example, [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage)).

If a mod does not document its commands, you can run the following command to list all available commands and identify which mod provides them:
