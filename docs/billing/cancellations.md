Hey Bloomers! In this guide we will be going over how to request a cancellation.

## How to request a cancellation

To request a cancellation go to the [services page](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=services) on our billing portal and select the service that you want to cancel, then click on the "Request Cancellation" button on the right sidebar. There you will be able to fill a cancellation form.

:::caution
Download a backup of all your files before submitting a cancellation request. Once the cancellation is processed all your server files will be deleted and you will not be able to access them.

## Refunds

:::caution
You may request a refund on the basis that you have submitted an "Immediate" cancellation request and fall within 72 hours of the initial payment, and activation of your service. Refund requests should be requested via a ticket through our [billing panel](https://billing.bloom.host/supporttickets.php). These refunds are only issued on a one-time per customer basis.

You can visit our [Refund documentation](/billing/refunds) to learn more about our refund policy. You can also read our [Terms and Service Policy](https://bloom.host/terms/).
