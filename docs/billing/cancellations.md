Hey Bloomers! In this guide we will be going over how to request a cancellation.

## How to request a cancellation

To request a cancellation go to the [services page](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=services) on our billing portal and select the service that you want to cancel, then click on the "Request Cancellation" button on the right sidebar. There you will be able to fill a cancellation form.

:::caution
Download a backup of all your files before submitting a cancellation request. Once the cancellation is processed all your server files will be deleted and you will not be able to access them.

:::caution
IMPORTANT: You have to manually cancel your PayPal Subscription (Recurring Payment) after you request a refund or cancellation, otherwise PayPal will continue to send us the payment for your server. Please follow the instructions below to avoid overpayments.

Note: If you paid with Credit/Debit Card using Stripe you don't have to manually disable your subscription/recurring payment, it gets automatically disabled once you submit the cancellation request.
