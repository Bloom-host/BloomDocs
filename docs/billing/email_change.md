<h1>How to change your account email address</h1>

Hey Bloomers! In this guide we will be going over how to change your account email address in our Billing and Minecraft panel.

## How to change your Billing Panel Email Address

The billing system we use require you to change your email address on two sections, the account details section and the profile section. You may face sign in or notification issues if you change your email address on only one of these sections, so make sure you change the email on both of them.

To change your email address first go to the [Account Details section](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=details), sign in with your billing credentials and put the new email on the **Email Address** field then click on save.

The second step is to change your email address on the [Profile section](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=profile), sign in with your billing credentials and put the new email on the **Email Address** field then click on save.
