## Configuring a Stripe Subscription when you first order a server

## Configuring a PayPal Subscription when you are already a customer

If you have already a plan with us you will need to wait until the next invoice generates, then go to the invoices section on our [billing portal](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=invoices), select the latest unpaid invoice and under payment method select "Credit/Debit Card - Subscription" and configure the subscription.
