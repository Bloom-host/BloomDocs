Hey Bloomers! In this guide we will be going over how to request a refund.

## How to know if you are eligible for a refund

This is our Refund Policy which can be found on our [Terms and Conditions](https://bloom.host/terms/)

Refunds will not be processed for "End of Billing Period" cancellation requests. Your service will remain active until your next invoice would usually be due and you will not be charged thereafter. When required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable, exempting Subscriptions that fall within our 72-hour policy.

You may request a refund on the basis that you have submitted an "Immediate" cancellation request and fall within 72 hours of the initial payment, and activation of your service. Refund requests should be requested via a ticket through our [billing panel](https://billing.bloom.host/supporttickets.php). These refunds are only issued on a one-time per customer basis.

Refund requests that fall outside of the aforementioned 72 hours may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and judged at the sole discretion of the Company.

## How to request a refund

Refund requests should be requested via a ticket through our [billing panel](https://billing.bloom.host/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3).

You also need to request an immediate cancellation for your service. To do so go to the [services section](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=services) on our billing panel, select the service you want to cancel and click on "Request Cancellation" on the right sidebar. Then on the reason write "Requesting refund" and on Cancellation Type leave it on "Immediate".

:::caution
Download a backup of all your files before submitting a refund request. Once the refund is processed all your server files will be deleted and you will not be able to access them.

## PayPal Subscriptions (Recurring Payments) need to be cancelled manually

:::caution
IMPORTANT: You have to manually cancel your PayPal Subscription (Recurring Payment) after you request a refund or cancellation, otherwise PayPal will continue to send us the payment for your server. Please refer to our guide on [how to cancel a PayPal Subscription](/billing/paypal) to avoid overpayments.
