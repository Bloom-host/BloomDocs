This guide gives you a step by step method on creating your own server-pack for a custom modpack, or a modpack that doesnt have a useable server-pack yet.

:::warning

While Server-pack Creator can make serverpacks its not perfect and doesnt have a 100% garuntee in making the serverpack functional.

Requirements!
Java 21+

Terminology
Server Pack Creator -> SPC (to make it easier to type out)
:::

1. Open SPC and select your custom modpacks folder. IT CANNOT BE A ZIP/TAR.GZ OR ANY OTHER COMPRESSED FILE.
2. When selected, SPC should automatically locate the Minecraft verion, Modloader, and Modloader version. If it does not you might have not selected the right folder. If you use Prism launcher, the modpack directory would be inside prismlauncher/instances/YOURMODPACK/minecraft
