description: Instructions on how to change the version of Java used on your server
---

Bloom.host offers different versions of Java to suit your server. The default Java 11 (8 for Forge servers if you specified that when purchasing your server.) will suit most people.
This guide will show you how to change the version of Java if it does not work for your server.

1. Firstly you want to go to the [Minecraft server control panel](https://mc.bloom.host/) and select the server that you want to change the Java version of.
2. On the left side, select 'Startup'.
3. Next, find the Java Version tab (usually on the top right of the page)

:::caution
All Minecraft 1.18 - 1.20.4 versions require Java 17 to work. Use the Java 17 option to use Java 17 on your server.

Minecraft 1.20.5+ will require a minimum of Java 21 to work.

If you are unable to change this next setting and you see a message such as "This server's Docker image has been manually set by an administrator and cannot be changed through this UI.", please [open a ticket on the support Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/bloom) and Bloom.host staff will need to change this for you.
