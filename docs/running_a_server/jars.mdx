  ### What is Forge?
  
  > Forge is a modding API for Minecraft. Users who download and install Minecraft Forge can install mods (modifications) to Minecraft Instances.

  On this menu set version to that required by your mods and build to the latest one available (top of the list).
  
  Once the Change Server Type menu has been configured, press the Change Server Type button, this will prompt you to [make a backup](../using_the_panel/backups.md) and it is advised to do so.
  
  Once the server has started again and finished running the installer you can go on to install mods!
