## How to change your MOTD without a plugin

First you need to write your MOTD, you can use [this website](https://mctools.org/motd-creator) to help you. Once  you have your MOTD like you want it, copy the `server.properties` code, like the one shown below
![server.properties](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716405933105872938/751221395622723715/unknown.png)
Open your server panel and head to File Explorer, if you need a hand, check out [this guide!](https://docs.bloom.host/file-manager-controls). Now, enter your `server.properties` and head to the motd section and paste the copied text where the old one was, then restart your server and your changes will be made.
