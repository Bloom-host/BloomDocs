# Multiverse-Core

## What does it do?

Multiverse core allows you to create multiple different worlds in one server. You can import maps and create worlds with custom generation! It also easily allows you to teleport to each world that you create using the commands /mv list and /mv tp. Here's an example of the worlds that you could have on your server:

This example shows some of the worlds being our very own and also some of the worlds being imported into our server.  

[This guide](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Basics) outlines how to set up worlds, import worlds, and some basic settings for the plugin.  

[This other guide](/plugins/pwi) outlines how to setup Per World Inventory, a plugin for seperating inventories per world.

That's about it for multiverse! If you need any more help, feel free to make a ticket in the [discord](discord.gg/bloom) :)
