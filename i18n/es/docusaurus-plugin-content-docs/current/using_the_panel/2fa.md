## Game Panel 2FA

To setup 2FA in the game panel area, head over to [Account Security](https://mc.bloom.host/account/security) in the game panel area.

Hit **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** to show a QR code that you can scan. 

For this, download an app on your phone that is a 2FA app, such as [Authy](https://authy.com/).

Then, add a new account and scan the QR code. Once it is scanned, type the token that you have on the app into the Authentication Token box.
