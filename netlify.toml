# These redirects were added when the multi-platform category for plugins and mods was added.
# Some existing plugin/mod pages were moved (and in some cases, merged) from the platform-specific folder into the multi-platform folder.
# These redirect rules are to allow old links to continue to work as they get redirected to the new locations.
