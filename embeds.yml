    servers out there.
    
    PaperMC is compatible with every plugin that works on Spigot (except outdated ones, you shouldn't be using these either way), and even improves performance on some optimized plugins meant to work better on Paper.

    If you see the error: **We're having some trouble connecting to your server,
    please wait...** on the panel and our support team has confirmed that there
    is no issue with the panel, your server or the node itself please follow the
    steps listed below:
    - Try clearing your browser cache from the browser settings or use Ctrl + F5 while on the Bloom panel.
    - Try using incognito mode on your browser to access the panel. (At the top right of your browser, click the three dots and then New Incognito Window.)
    - Try another browser.
    
    If the steps above don't fix it then it indicates you may have an issue with your network connection, if that's the case follow the steps below:
    - Try accessing the panel with your phone using mobile data and not wifi. You can also share a hotspot to your PC.
    - Try using a VPN like Cloudflare WARP https://1.1.1.1/ and see if that fixes it. If the issue gets fixed by using a VPN then there's an issue with your network connection. You can try restarting your router/modem and computer and see if that fixes it, if not then you may need to contact your ISP to report the issue.

    To request a plan upgrade, downgrade or a change of location go to the Products section of our billing panel [here](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=services), sign in with your Billing Account, click the three dots to the right side of the Product you want to upgrade, then select the Upgrade/Downgrade button.

    On the upgrade page you will be able to select to what location and plan you want to upgrade/downgrade to, here you can also switch between datacenter locations. Once you select the plan it will generate an invoice (if needed) which needs to be paid before the upgrade and transfer process begins.

    **If you want to upgrade/downgrade a VPS or downgrade to a Minecraft Essentials plan open a Billing Ticket [here](https://billing.bloom.host/clientarea.php?action=services)**
